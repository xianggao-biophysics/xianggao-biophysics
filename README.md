### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**This is Xiang Gao :hedgehog:**  

- :monkey_face: I am a programmer who uses C/C++ a lot for instrument control and numerical analysis.  
- :notebook_with_decorative_cover: I am teaching myself CUDA now.  
- :knot: I am currently learning knot theory to see if there is any knot invariant that is easier to compute than the Alexandra polynomial. I hope it can speed up the current Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the torque to braid 2 DNA molecules.  
- :mailbox_with_mail: How to reach me: xianggao.biophysics@gmail.com
